      <h1>Manipulated Images</h1>
      <h3>The original Image</h3>
      <img src="Img.jpeg">
      <p>This is an image I found on the internet I believe has been manipulated and edited. This image is taken from a ground surface showing a street with its reflection from the water
        This image seems to have its colour sharpened and the reflection of the water has been made clearer than it actually should have been
        possibly by making by just taking what is the actual street and pasting it in place of the reflection.
      </p>

      <h3>AI's description of the original image</h3>
      <p>The image appears to be a photograph of a puddle on the ground reflecting the surroundings above it. The reflection in the puddle shows a partially cloudy sky with a few trees and tall buildings in the background. The puddle itself is surrounded by pavement and appears to have some ripples in it, likely caused by raindrops or wind. The water in the puddle is relatively still and reflects the surrounding objects in a distorted but recognizable manner. The photo has a shallow depth of field and the focus is primarily on the reflection in the puddle, with the pavement and surrounding environment slightly blurred.</p>

      <h3>The AI generated Image of ChatGPT's description</h3>
      <img src="craiyon_195426_The_image_appears_to_be_a_photograph_of_a_puddle_on_the_ground_reflecting_the_surroun.png">

      <h3>Which one is similar?</h3>
      <p>
      After observing both images, both images have a puddle in front of it but the environment and the surrounding is quite different.
      The image generated from the AI's description only shows two buildings in front, some trees and bushes and reflects half of the two buildings
      in the puddle. The image generated from my description where if you notice, the images might be blurred reflects more of the street
      than the puddle of the AI generated description which is why I believe my descriptions image is closer to the original.
