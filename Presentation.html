      <p>This presentation is about the new Media arts introduction to the world. New media art for anyone who does not understand it is an umbrella term that encompasses art forms that are either produced, modified, and transmitted by means of new media/digital technologies or, in a broader sense, make use of “new” and emerging technologies that originate from a scientific, military, or industrial context. The presentation essentially asks the question what is art? As the presentation shows, how there is no way to truly understand what art is. Marcel Deschamp once entered an art competition and submitted an overturned urinal as his project for it. It was considered controversial because the boundaries for what should be considered art was practically non-existent. However, TV and visual art was still not considered art at the time but it was growing very quickly since majority of the houses had coloured TV by the time. The Canadian author Marshall McLuhan helped people understand that the new media was a new language that reshaped the old world at will. Guerilla videographers forced their way into political conventions and newsworthy events, producing alternative coverage that resulted in an entertaining, provocative look at American politics. The day video art was born was considered to be the day when Korean born Fluxus artist Nam June Paik bought one of the first Sony Portapak video sets in New York in 1965. Andy Warhol made his first double projection film by filming two 30-minute tapes of a member of his cohort and then incorporating them together weeks before Paik's presentation. Video art was considered an extension of their work because they were already established artists at that time. Wolf Vostell's placement of television monitors amidst what he called his 'De-coll/ages' liberated and separated the television medium from the control of commercial producers, providing a rallying point for the video and electronic art. The capacity that video art held due to its instantaneous transmission of image was the most appealing feature for these artists. They created innovative gadgets for artists in the digital processing and electronic art.</p>
